## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Supabase account (for the database)
- Resend account (for email services)
- Redis instance (for rate limiting) - optional but recommended

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/esdrassantos06/tarevity.git
   cd tarevity
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

   ```env
   # Next Auth
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secure_secret
   # Tip: Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32

   # App
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

   # Environment
   NODE_ENV=development # or production

   # OAuth Providers
   GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
   GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
   GOOGLE_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

   # Supabase
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

   # Email (Resend)
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com

   # Rate Limiting (Redis)
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
   REDIS_TOKEN=your_redis_token
   ```

4. Configure the Supabase database

   - Create a new organization and project in Supabase
   - The database structure should include the following tables:
     - `users`: User accounts and authentication data
     - `todos`: Task data linked to users
     - `password_reset_tokens`: For the password recovery system
     - `refresh_tokens`: For JWT token refresh mechanism
   - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies to restrict data access

5. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

6. Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
